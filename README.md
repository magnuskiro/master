My master Thesis and the work around it.

### Working Title (Temporary)
Tweets correlation between sentiment and opinion, associated with the financial impact of tweets.

### Working Description (Temporary)
The project deals with the correlations between the tweets and the stock value.
The student will start with finding the stock relevant tweets and pre process
them. 

It has been argued that people talk about a company especially when there are
some events that may negatively effect the stock price of the company. The
student will investigate this hypothesis and also analyse the content of tweets
with respect to the sentiment and opinion.
