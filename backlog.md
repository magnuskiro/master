## Experiments / research
* Find out how much of a tweet is useful. 
* Explore trends in trade volume. 
* Explore the meta data we can get from twitter (not tweets).
* Is change in market volume related to change in tweet volume? Or the other way around?
* why are the modal weak and modal strong separate? 
* figure out how I express sentiment. 
* find out if IBM Watson has used some smart NLP algorithms or techniques fro classification of processing.  
* Can the topic detection of Watson be useful? 

## Code
* Get two tweet dataset. 1k tweets. test and training. 
* Get meta data from twitter. 
* POS: part of speech. 
* Clustering of similar tweets.
* Clustering of tweets on users/location/language
* topic detection of tweets, Finance? 
* Find out what the language R is. 
* Take into consideration the different dictionaries. 
* Take negation into consideration in the classification. 
* Tweet credibility. (how much weight should credibility add?)
