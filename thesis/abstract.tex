\textbf{Background:}
As Twitter has become a global microblogging site, its influence in the stock
market has become significant. This makes tweets an interesting medium for
gathering sentiment. A sentiment that can predict the trends in the stock
market. 

\textbf{Motivation} 
If twitter can be used to predict trends in the stock market, that would give
the casual investor an advantage over the day-trader or the modern trading algorithms. 

Another interesting aspect is the role of twitter in sentiment
analysis. And how twitter can be used as a data source for trend prediction or
event detection.  

\textbf{Methods and experiments} 
% todo use the right method descriptions and what I have used. 
Positive/negative words, topology graphs, and feature addition are investigated
as possible methods for classifying tweet sentiment. 

\textbf{Results:} 
Rough results of my research. 

\textbf{Conclusion:} 
All OK ? No?
