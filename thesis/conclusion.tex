\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The Twitter API and mining of tweets started out as a challenge. But after
working out the quirks tweets was mined efficiently. The tweets we used worked,
but the quality of them is questionable. The verdict of the data is that it
provided results in the end.    

Tweets were classified manually and by classifier. Classifiers worked better
than the bag of words method. The classifiers had high accuracy. Which is good.
But also a cause for concern. 

Aggregation of trends worked to some degree. The finance plotting work as
expected, while the Twitter trend was difficult. The plotted trends had very
few similarities and thus we conclude that technical analysis is still better
than sentiment analysis for predicting the stock market.  

The questions we set out to answer and the achievements of those can be
summarised as follows. We can determine the sentiment of a tweet by counting
words, but classifiers work better. Trends can be aggregated with data from
twitter, but the trend created so far is not very useful. And last we can safely
say that technical analysis of stock markets work better than the current sentiment analysis.
