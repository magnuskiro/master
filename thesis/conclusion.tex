\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

Over all the data used worked. The quality of the data is questionable. But it
provided results. After the challenges with the Twitter API was resolved data
flowed in when needed.  

Tweets were classified. Manually and by classifier. Classifiers worked better
than the bag of words method. The classifiers had high accuracy. Which is good.
But also a cause for concern. 

Aggregation of trends worked to some degree. The finance plotting work as
expected, while the Twitter trend was difficult. The plotted trends had very
few similarities and thus we conclude that technical analysis is still better
than sentiment analysis for predicting the stock market.  

Throughout the process with this thesis a number of problems emerged. Most
problems was solved within reasonable time. But yet again we learn that
starting early is the key to great achievements. With more time we would have
corrected many minor issues with the research and probably gained better
results.  

For the questions we started out to answer. We can determine the sentiment of a
tweet by counting words, but classifiers work better. Trends can be aggregated
with data from twitter, but the trend created so far is not very useful. And
last we can safely say that technical analysis of stock markets work better
than the current sentiment analysis.
