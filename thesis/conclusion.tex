\chapter{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

The Twitter API and mining of tweets started as a challenge. But after
working out the quirks tweets was mined efficiently. The data worked,
but the quality is questionable. The verdict of the data is that it
provide results, but can be improved.    

Tweets were classified manually and by classifier. Classifiers worked better
than the bag of words method. The classifiers had high accuracy. Which is good.
But also a cause for concern. 

Aggregation of trends worked to some degree. The finance plotting work as
expected, while the Twitter sentiment trend was difficult. The plotted trends had very
few similarities and thus we conclude that technical analysis is still better
than sentiment analysis for predicting the stock market.  

The questions we set out to answer, and the achievements of those, can be
summarised as follows. We can determine the sentiment of a tweet by counting
words, but trained classifiers work better. Trends can be aggregated with data
from Twitter, but the trend created so far is not very useful. Last we can
safely say that technical analysis of stock markets work better than the current
sentiment analysis.
