\section{Research questions}
	\paragraph{Can tweets be used to determine a trend in the stock market?\\}
	We will look at the usefulness of tweets as a way to extract sentiment. And
then look at possible applications for the sentiment in the stock market. 
Does the use of positive and negative words in the classification of tweets
have an impact on the determination of the trend and what effects does the
polarity of a tweet have on the trend?

microblogging site can be used to predict trends in the stock market.

* We would also like to find out which parts of twitter are the most useful
ones. 

* Which twitter sources are most suitable for predicting the stock market

quality of the trend prediction. 

	\paragraph{How does these trends compare to the technical analysis in the
stock market?\\}

market will  give us insight in to the possibility to predict financial trends
over longer periods of time then a few days. Researchers has already looked at
