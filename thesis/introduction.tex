\section{Research questions}
	\paragraph{Can tweets be used to determine a trend in the stock market?\\}
	We will look at the usefulness of tweets as a way to extract sentiment. And
then look at possible applications for the sentiment in the stock market. 
Does the use of positive and negative words in the classification of tweets
have an impact on the determination of the trend and what effects does the
polarity of a tweet have on the trend?

	\paragraph{How can twitter be used to predict trends in the stock market?\\}
* On a more abstract level we would like to find out whether or not twitter as a
microblogging site can be used to predict trends in the stock market.

* We would also like to find out which parts of twitter are the most useful
ones. 

* Which twitter sources are most suitable for predicting the stock market
trend?

* Credibility, what sort of credibility level has to be attained to certify the
quality of the trend prediction. 

	\paragraph{How does trends on twitter compare to technical analysis in the
stock market?\\}

In finance, the moving average is a result of technical analysis. This and
other trend defining qualities of financial data is used to compile trends. 

Twitter has data such as the amount of tweets posted today, the location where
tweets are posted from, and which users has posted. Aggregated, these data
become a trend. 

Previously researchers have managed to predict direction of the market the
next few days based on the volume of tweets. 

We are interested in the correlation between trends on twitter and the moving
average in finance. Hopefully this will give some insight of how sentiment on
twitter influences the sock market.
