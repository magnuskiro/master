This section describes the experiments done. High level description and
execution of experiments. Detailed execution and technical details in appendix. 

#TODO what is sentiment \\
Sentiment is described as "an attitude toward something; regard; opinion."\footnote{Sentiment - Dictionary.com: \url{http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sentiment?s=t}}



#TODO why do we get it \\
#TODO how do we use it \\

% todo figure out what experiments are smart to do. 

* Experiment with the time frame of the prediction of the trend. 
	* Typically the variation of time. What's the longest into the future that
we can predict the trend?

\section{Word count classification}
Comparison of positive vs negative words.

A basic approach to classification is to count words. Positive and negative
words. To do this it is necessary have dictionaries to provide the
classification of simple words. Section:\ref{data:dictionaries} describes the
dictionaries used. Some of them are quite simple, while others are more
extensive. 

#TODO description of method. 

\subsection{Classification}

\paragraph{Polarity} 
\hspace{0pt}\\ 
#TODO calculating the polarity.  

The polarity of a given tweet is based on the difference in the amount of
positive verses negative words.

pos/totw - neg/totw 

\paragraph{Threshold} 
\hspace{0pt}\\ 
Threshold is the ratio of positive vs negative words that has to be present for a
tweet to be either positive of negative.

The percentage of positive words minus the percentage of negative words gives
the polarity value, or the positivity(how positive a tweet is) of a tweet. 
When actually deciding if a tweet is positive or negative we look at the
polarity value. If the polarity value is above the threshold (polarity >
threshold) the tweet is classified as positive. 

\paragraph{Examples of classification follows:} 
\hspace{0pt}\\ 
Example tweets:
\begin{itemize}
    \item t1 = “good that he was decreasing badly”
    \item t2 = “he was good for increase” 
    \item t3 = “good or bad”
\end{itemize}

Classification of t1:
\begin{itemize}
    \item pos = 1 / 6 = 0.16666
    \item neg = 2 / 6 = 0.33333
    \item polarity = pos - neg = -0.1667
    \item threshold of 0 gives negative classification
    \item threshold of 0.1 gives negative classification
    \item threshold of -0.2 gives positive classification
\end{itemize}

Classification of t2:
\begin{itemize}
    \item pos = 2 / 5 (to av fem ord) = 0.4
    \item neg = 0 / 5 = 0
    \item polarity = pos - neg = 0.4 - 0.0 = 0.4
    \item threshold = 0.4 ⇒ positive
    \item threshold = 0.5 ⇒ negative
    \item threshold = -0.1 ⇒ positive
\end{itemize}

Classification of t3:
\begin{itemize}
    \item pos = 1 / 3 = 0.3333
    \item neg = 1 / 3 = 0.3333
    \item polarity = pos - neg = 0
    \item threshold = 0 ⇒ positive
    \item threshold = 0.1 ⇒ negative
    \item threshold = -0.1 ⇒ positive
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Results}
#TODO write results from the classification of the different dictionaries. \\
#TODO write about the variations based on the datasets. \\

\paragraph{Threshold variations}
\hspace{0pt}\\
By varying the threshold we hoped to find an optimal point of which we could
separate tweets based on polarity. From the following
graphs, figure \ref{fig:threshold_graphs}, we can see no clear distinction of
one value being better than the other ones.  

In figure \ref{fig:threshold_graphs} we list the results of the experimentation
with the threshold. Table \ref{tbl:dictionary_to_threshold} lists the
dictionaries and dataset used for which graphs in figure \ref{fig:threshold_graphs}.
'kiro dataset' and 'obama dataset' columns tells which dataset that was
classified in which graph.

\begin{tabular}{ l c c }
\hspace{0pt}\\
Dictionary name and description & kiro dataset & obama dataset \\ 
Obama original, Monogram & 1 & 10 \\
LoughranMcDonald, Monogram & 2 & 11 \\
Combined Obama original and \\ LoughranMcDonald, Monogram & 3 & 12 \\
Kiro, Monogram, self compiled & 4 & 13 \\
Obama, Monogram, self compiled & 5 & 14 \\
Kiro, Bigram, self compiled & 6 & 15 \\
Obama, Bigram, self compiled & 7 & 16 \\
Kiro, Trigram, self compiled & 8 & 17 \\
Obama, Trigram, self compiled & 9 & 18 \\

\subsection{Drawbacks}
#TODO write about drawbacks.
\paragraph{Dictionaries}
\paragraph{Word positioning}
The dictionaries are based on the manually labeled
tweets, so we can't create bi and tri-grams based on the position of a word in a tweet.
Rather there is no way of automatically decide if a single word is positive or
negative. 

\section{With Classifiers}
