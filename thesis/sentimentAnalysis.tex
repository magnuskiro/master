\subsection{Recreate sentiment classification with lexicons of positive and
negative words.}

A basic approach to classification is to count words. Positive and negative
words. To do this it is necessary have dictionaries to provide the
classification of simple words. Section:\ref{sec:dict} describes the
dictionaries used. Some of them are quite simple, while others are more
extensive. 

The polarity of a given tweet is based on the difference in the amount of
positive verses negative words. 

Todo: run an experiment with 100+ tweets to see to what extent the
classification works. Further this has to be compared to a control set, of
manually classified tweets.
